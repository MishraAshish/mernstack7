//EventLoop : all those calls which are expected to have delays due to 
//transactions taking time like settimeout, setinterval, server calls (XHR) or file read (async) or any registered callback using Promises
//server - (XHR) XMLHttpRequest api used to make server call

//Everything needs to looked in event loop for stack empty, expect the sutffs present in prioity queue
